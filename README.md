Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

Scikit-learn (for clustering)

Key Features
Loaded and explored mall customer dataset.

Applied the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k=5).

Trained a K-Means model to segment customers into 5 distinct groups.

Visualized clusters to understand spending behaviors and customer distribution.

Identified actionable insights for marketing and customer retention strategies.

Output
Scatter plot visualizations of customer segments.

Clearly labeled clusters with meaningful groupings (e.g., high income, low spending; low income, high spending, etc.).
